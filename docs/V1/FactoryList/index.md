# Overview

## Introduction

This is a list of all of the classes available in the `GanbaroDigital\DIContainers\V1\FactoryList` namespace.

This component provides a factory-driven DI container, plus related method classes.

This container was originally created as a way of encapsulating `Library2` inside `Library1`.

* `Library1` can tell `Library2` to use exceptions defined by `Library1`.
* Anyone who is using `Library1` will not see (or have to catch) exceptions defined by `Library2`.
