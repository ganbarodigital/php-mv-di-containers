# Version 1.x

## Introduction

This is the initial version of our _Dependency-Injection Library_. It was built to replace using generic PHP arrays for dependency-injection.

## Components

Version 1 ships with the following components:

Namespace | Purpose
----------|--------
[`GanbaroDigital\DIContainers\V1\Exceptions`](Exceptions/index.html) | the exceptions that this library can throw
[`GanbaroDigital\DIContainers\V1\Interfaces`](Interfaces/index.html) | the interfaces defined by this library
[`GanbaroDigital\DIContainers\V1\FactoryList`](FactoryList/index.html) | a DI container for factories

Click on the namespace to learn more about the classes in that component.
